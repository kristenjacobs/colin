Programming:
===============================================================================

- Wire up the output validators

- Update the type validators to use the new look (WC3) datatypes + restrictions
  Is there a way that we can support the full set (i.e. can we get 
  the rng schema for the full set from somewhere)?

- Implement the regression test running framework including the 
  invariants and assertions.

- Implement a custom command mechanism using a
  generated jython interface, maybe using the output returned from the 
  console?

- Work out how the type-based completers are going to work
  (i.e. the file completor)?

- Add a example command that uses a variable argument list.

- How do we make the jing validator less verbose (i.e. quiet)?

- Need to implement the "-" scheme for refering to the ids in the model 

- Need to fix the TODO in the Console.java file.

===============================================================================
BUGS:
===============================================================================

- If there are errors in the config.xml valiadtion, ensure that the tool exits
  and does not enter the command loop

===============================================================================
REFACTORING:
===============================================================================

- Can we sort out the 'setOutputDisplay' mechanism in the CustomCommand class.
  I.e. instead of effectively setting a global in the console, maybe the console 
  should be calling back into the command to see of the output should be displayed
  for this command, and in the case of framework cammands, this is always true.
