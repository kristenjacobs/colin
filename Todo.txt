Implementation:
===============================================================================

- Wire up the output validators

- Implement the regression test running framework including the 
  invariants and assertions.

- Implement a custom command mechanism using a
  generated jython interface, maybe using the output returned from the 
  console?

- Work out how the type-based completers are going to work
  (i.e. the file completor)?

- Add a example command that uses a variable argument list.

- Need to implement the "-" scheme for refering to the ids in the model 

- Design a 'compact' (non xml) input language. Maybe make this look rather
  functional/haskell-ish. Also need a script to convert back and forth from the 
  compact form to the XML. If we have time, we should also make the framework accept
  input in this form. We could therefore either just write a custome parser, 
  or possibly we can also specify a grammar for this 
  and generate a parser (maybe using antler?)

===============================================================================
Testing:
===============================================================================

- Write some tests for both the argument and output validators 
  (i.e. a test for each supported datatype that both passes and fails the valiadation) 
  THIS NEEDS COMPLETING!!!

- Add tests for the common operations using the refdb application
  (These need to be specified in the COLIN language itself, then we can add
   tests that list all of the colin tests and runs all of the tests)
  e.g. 
      - Create/delete a reference
      - Add/remove attributes to a referecne
      - Set attributes on a reference
      - Test the saving and restoring mechanism
      **** Can we do all of the abobe using the references for this dissertation ****
