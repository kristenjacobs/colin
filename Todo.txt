===============================================================================
Implementation:
===============================================================================

- Implement a custom command mechanism using a
  generated jython interface, maybe using the output returned from the 
  console?

- Implement the regression test running framework:
      - invariants
      - assertions (equals and regex)
      - scripts

- Design a 'compact' (non xml) input language. Maybe make this look rather
  functional/haskell-ish. Also need a script to convert to this from the XML. 

- Combine the 'extension' and 'commands' nodes in the colin language.

- Add some comments to the code in general, focusing on the code that
  is called from the application (i.e. the ModelFactory/creation + TypeUtils)

- Replace all the tabs with spaces!

- Create an external script which populates the refdb with the referecnces used
  in the dissertation.

- Autogenerate the appendix

===============================================================================
Testing:
===============================================================================

- Add tests for the common operations using the refdb application
  (These need to be specified in the COLIN language itself, then we can add
   tests that list all of the colin tests and runs all of the tests)
  e.g. 
      - Create/delete a reference
      - Add/remove attributes to a reference
      - Set attributes on a reference
      - Test the saving and restoring mechanism
      **** Can we do all of the abobe using the references for this dissertation ****

- Need to add the following 2 tests:
    - testcase list (both full and partial)
    - testcase run (both full and partial)

===============================================================================
Bugs:
===============================================================================

- If an invalid refid is used in a refdb command, it currently does not error 
  on this case.

===============================================================================
Optional:
===============================================================================

- Add a html report extension 'report html' command

- Make it possible to split the configuration (colin) xml file acrross multiple files.

- Make the framework accept input in the form of the compact colin language. 
  We could therefore either just write a custom parser, 
  or possibly we can also specify a grammar for this 
  and generate a parser (maybe using antler?)

- Allow custom commands to accept optional arguments.
