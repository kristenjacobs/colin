===============================================================================
Implementation:
===============================================================================

- Design a 'compact' (non xml) input language. Maybe make this look rather
  functional/haskell-ish. Also need a script to convert to this from the XML
  (add this as a make target as above)

- Add some comments to the code in general, focusing on the code that
  is called from the application (i.e. the ModelFactory/creation + TypeUtils)

- Autogenerate the appendix

===============================================================================
Bugs:
===============================================================================

- If an invalid refid is used in a refdb command, it currently does not error 
  on this case. Fix this and add a test for it!

===============================================================================
Optional:
===============================================================================

- Add a html report extension 'report html' command

- Make it possible to split the configuration (colin) xml file acrross multiple files.

- Make the framework accept input in the form of the compact colin language. 
  We could therefore either just write a custom parser, 
  or possibly we can also specify a grammar for this 
  and generate a parser (maybe using antler?)

- Allow custom commands to accept optional arguments.

- Measure the coverage for the tests
