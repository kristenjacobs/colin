Notes on the script output/display isues
========================================

Sourcing a script is done from 3 places:
----------------------------------------

1) Called by the user via an explicit source command (USER SCRIPT) 

2) Called by the system because the user has called a command that is implemented via a script (EXTENSION SCRIPT)

3) Called by the test system in the case where the test is implemented via a script (TEST SCRIPT)

How should the output be handled in each case???
------------------------------------------------

1) Here the context is INTERNAL:

    - All direct script output is displayed

    - For commands called from within the script, the 
      output is only displayed if the commands output mode
      is set to ALL or INTERNAL

    - The output from each command called from within the script 
      is always caputured and is used as the return value of the 
      command, thus it can be used from within the script

2) Here the context is INTERNAL:

    - All direct script output is displayed

    - For commands called from within the script, the 
      output is only displayed if the commands output mode
      is set to ALL or INTERNAL

    - The output from each command called from within the script 
      is always caputured and is used as the return value of the 
      command, thus it can be used from within the script

3) Here the context is ????:

    - Direct script output is not displayed

    - For commands called from within the script, the 
      output is never displayed

    - The output from each command called from within the script 
      is always caputured and is used as the return value of the 
      command, thus it can be used from within the script

    - The output from the entire script is captured into the test variable.
      This consists of the following:
          - Direct output
          - For commands called from within the test script, the 
            output is only added to the final script output if the commands output mode
            is set to ALL or INTERNAL

So, the question is: How do we satisfy the above?
